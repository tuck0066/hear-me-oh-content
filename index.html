      <h2>Sloths</h2>
      <div id="sloth">
        <p>Sloths are mammals classified in the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloths) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem slow and lazy at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptations for conserving energy.</p>
        <p>Aside from their surprising speed during emergency flights from predators, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs.</p>

        <p>Three-toed sloth featured with an ant-eater, a platypus & armadillos.</p>
        <p>They are classified in the order Pilosa because they are related to anteaters, which sport a similar set of specialized claws. Extinct sloth species include many megafaunal ground sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants, as well as a few species of marine sloths. Extant sloths are medium-sized arboreal (tree-dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America.</p>
        <p>Sloths make good habitats for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, ciliates, and algae.</p>

      <h2>Three-toed sloth</h2>
      <img src="images/illustration.jpg" alt="" aria-details="three-toed">
      <p>The three-toed sloths are arboreal neotropical mammals (also known as “three-fingered” sloths)</p>
      <p>Famously slow-moving, a sloth travels at an average speed of 0.24 km/h. Three-toed sloths are about the size of a small dog or a large cat, with the head and body having a combined length around 45 cm and a weight of 3.5–4.5 kg. Unlike the two-toed sloths, they also have short tails of 6–7 cm, and they have three clawed toes on each limb.</p>
      <p>All sloths have three digits on their hindlimbs; the difference is found in the number of digits on the forelimbs; thus they are sometimes referred to as three-fingered sloths.</p>
